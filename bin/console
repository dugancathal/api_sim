# Welcome to HttpSim!
#
# You can boot a sample app by running the following
sample_app = HttpSim.build_app do
  configure_endpoint 'GET' , '/my-endpoint', 'Returns Hello!', 202
end

# You can inspect the endpoints that this app has:
puts "=" * 50, sample_app.endpoints, "=" * 50

# You can run that app one of two ways.
# Synchronously (you'll need to open a new window to play with the server):
sample_app.run!

# Asynchronously (to continue playing in this window):
Thread.new { sample_app.run! }

# You can stop the synchronous app by pressing CTRL+c.
# If running asynchronously, you can stop by simply exiting the console.
